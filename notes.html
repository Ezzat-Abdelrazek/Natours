      <h2>Building header part 1</h2>
      <p>
        Browsers are getting more consistent so we don't need to normalize our
        css.
      </p>
      <p>
        Background-position always ensure the starting point of the background
        image.
      </p>
      <p>
        Clip path clip our element or specifiy which part of it should be
        visible.
      </p>
      <p>h1 Is really important for seo so make sure h1 is descriptive.</p>
      <p>Watch out not all elements should be animated.</p>
      <p>Hover and active are related to the initial states</p>
      <p>transition should be on the initial state</p>

      <h2>How Css Works Behind the Scenes</h2>
      <p>
        Visual Formatting model: An agorthims that render our page using render
        tree.
      </p>
      <h2>How Css is parsed</h2>
      <p>Cascade algorthim resolve conflicts between declearations</p>
      <p>Cascades value is the value of the declaration that is applied.</p>
      <p>
        There is Our Css Rules(Author) and user rules and browser (User agent
        rules)
      </p>
      <p>How css resolve conflicts between conflicting declearations.</p>
      <p>Importance => specifity => Source Order</p>
      <ul>
        <li>User</li>
        <li>Author</li>
        <li>Author Declarations</li>
        <li>User Declarations</li>
        <li>User agent declarations</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        specifity is represented using four numbers each one represented the
        occurance of a certain selector.
      </p>
      <p>
        The value of the winning declearations is called the cascaded value
        since it's the result of the cascade algorthim
      </p>
      <p>
        Don't depend on the order of your declearations to resolve conflicts
      </p>
      <p>Psudeo class will not work if it's in a less specific Selector</p>
      <p>Child inherit computed value from it's parents</p>
      <p>
        if we used percentage in padding,margin... then the referencee point is
        the parent width.
      </p>
      <p>
        if we used "em" in padding and margin then the referencee point is the
        current element.
      </p>
      <p>Every CSS must have a value</p>
      <p>Children inherit the computed value of parent element</p>
      <p>
        inherit and initial are used to force inheritance and the initial value
      </p>
      <p>
        it's not a good practice to set the font of html element to an absolute
        value since this prevent the user from changeing default font size in
        the browser
      </p>
      <p>
        good practice to set border box on the universal selector to inherit
        then set it on the body element
      </p>
      <p>fill area which is area filled with background color.</p>
      <p>Normal flow elements are laid out based on the source code</p>
      <p>
        Stacking context are what determine in which order elements are render.
      </p>
      <p>
        opacity, transform and filter and a lot of others create a new stacking
        context.
      </p>
      <p>Components are the building blocks of your interface.</p>
      <p>Components should be independent</p>
      <p>
        To identify blocks ask your self if you can use it somewhere else and it
        will have a meaning, or when it has 2 elements or more and the name is
        getting out of hand.
      </p>
      <p>
        Component or modifier depend if the element of that component is
        different completely different.
      </p>
      <p>Modifier is the same eleemnt with a slightly different variation.</p>
      <p>Identify your blocks</p>
      <p>
        In BEM A block is a Component and an element is a part of that component
      </p>
      <p>Architect: the 7-1 Pattern</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Base</li>
        <li>Components: One file for each componenet</li>
        <li>Layout</li>
        <li>Pages</li>
        <li>Themes</li>
        <li>Abstracts: Code that doesn't output an certain CSS</li>
        <li>Vendors: Third Party CSS</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>SASS</h2>
      <p>
        SASS is CSS preprocessor, which is an extension to CSS that adds power
        and elegance to the basic language.
      </p>
      <p>
        Called preprocessor because we need to process SASS before sending it.
      </p>
      <p>
        MIXIN Vs function: Function produce a value at the end while mixin
        don't.
      </p>
      <p>
        SCSS is the same as SASS but with slightly different syntax variation.
      </p>
      <h3>Varibales</h3>
      <p>Variables are identified with the dollar sign.</p>
      <p>& is equal to the selector path up to this point.</p>
      <p>Avoid repetition in SASS</p>
      <p>SASS HAS Great Color function like darken and many more....</p>
      <p>"@include" is used to include the mixin</p>
      <p>mixins can have parameters.</p>
      <p>
        We use % sign to define a placeholder then we use the extend keyword to
        extend that placeholder.
      </p>
      <p>
        placeholder doesn't repeat the code while the mixin repeat the code in
        multiple places in the compiled code.
      </p>
      <p>Only use extend for related Selector.</p>
      <p>Valid css is a valid SCSS</p>
      <p>
        in sass we can write hexDecimal in the rgb function and it will be
        converted for us.
      </p>
      <p>BEM Low specifity selector</p>
      <p>When use nested we encapsulate all related stuff in just one block</p>
      <p>
        max-width if the viewport is less than the specified width then
        max-width will fill 100%
      </p>
      <p>
        by setting value to "auto" then the browser will figure out the value
        while rendering the site.
      </p>
      <p>calc function allow us to mix units in calculations.</p>
      <p>
        in sass we can't mix units because a lot of values is figured out during
        the rendering phase of the website
      </p>
      <p>
        we have to wrap sass variable like this "#{variable}" in order to use in
        calc function
      </p>
      <p>Be crazy with transform.</p>
      <p>margin: 0 auto don't work on inline block element</p>
      <p>
        Utility classes are reusable classes with only one very specific goal
      </p>
      <p>Make sure your classes are reusable</p>
      <p>Use as many utility classes as you want</p>
      <p>Always think how to make it reusable, independent</p>
      <p>if it's a small unit you can leave it as pixels</p>
      <p>blur is probably right</p>
      <p>make unnoticed changes</p>
      <p>outline and outline offset are good</p>
      <p>
        We can apply affects to other elements when we hover on some of them.
      </p>
      <p>
        i stands for italic but we use it for fonts since any element could
        work.
      </p>
      <p>font icons are just fonts.</p>
      <p>You are really smart believe that.</p>
      <p>look for future reusability</p>
      <p>
        Don't forget about the existance of figure whenever we have an image
        with a caption.
